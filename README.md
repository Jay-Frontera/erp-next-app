# ERP Next system

This ERP is basically a powerful tool that also needs upgrades after my real world testing.

Currently it's just built as a quick solution as i've built it 6hours before I started using it.

# Utilities

* Administrate the items on storage
* Display the items that went in/out or were lost
* Show the current status of the items
* Show and control the buys/sells as well saving it online
* Has capabilities of working multiple people in the app at the same time as it's web based
* Mobile compatibility as I made it for using on my phone during the work time.
* It's useful for making data analytics later on due to the data collection possibilities.
* Can be used to make customer inhouse accounts for letting they pay later on (need to improve)

# Deployment

For deployment, the outdir is on next.config as it's configured for netlify and that's all you need to know basically as the website api is also on next.
You also should change you .env.local env files as currently is only the `MONGO_URI`

# TODO

Make it look cool at first place.
Make it faster and easier somehow as when there's high volume is hard to manage.

# Conclusion

I'm probably not keeping in touch with this and going to make it a archive.

Will re-use the clients system since it had a really good use-case.
